# DragDrop-TypeScript
This project is very simple.

You can enter three inputs: Project Title, Project Description and Project People (Simply means the number of people who worked with project) After that your project will be visible in Active table. You can drag project and hover it over Finished table. If you do so, the project you dragged will change it status and table to finished. Inputs are validated.

The idea behind this project was to explore TypeScript features. It uses Types, Interfaces, Generics and Decorators.
